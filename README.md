# 🎨 Khyathi Nandini | Artist & Future Game Developer

I'm currently bridging the gap between **Art** and **Game Development**. My journey is all about learning how to bring my drawings to life through code.

### 🎨 The Artistic Side
* 🖌️ **Digital & Traditional Art:** currently using Krita and ibisPaint for 2D character design and world-building.
* 👾 **Pixel Art (Beginner):** learning pixel art and Creating custom character sprites and tilesets for 2D game projects.
* 📦 **3D Modeling (Beginner):** Just started my journey in **Blender** Exploring the **Grease Pencil** tool for 2D hand-drawn animation and to create 3D assets and environment props for games.
* 🎞️ **Animation (Beginner):** Studying the **12 Principles of Animation** to create fluid "game feel." Currently mastering timing and weight through mini-exercises.
